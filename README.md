# 🌟 Nova – AI Voice Assistant (Powered by Perplexity API)

Nova is an intelligent **voice-based virtual assistant** built in Python that can listen to your commands, talk back using text-to-speech, perform web tasks, play music, and answer general questions using the **Perplexity AI API**.

Nova works similar to Alexa or Google Assistant — it wakes up when you say “**Nova**”, listens to your command, and responds smartly through speech.
